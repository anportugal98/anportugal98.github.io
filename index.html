<h2>ALL ABOUT MYSELF</h2>

<p>
My name is Andrea Nica Portugal, 19 years of existence. <br>
I was born on December 31, 2001 in General Trias, Cavite. <br>
I am currently residing at Sahud Ulan Tanza, Cavite. <br>
</p>

<p>
I am living with my parents and my younger sister but <br>
I have 4 siblings, 2 of them are my step-brothers, who also <br>
became precious to me. My eldest brother is in Singapore, <br>
working as an I.T. programmer, and I got inspired because of him. <br>
Our family is religious and have a strong faith in God and His plans in our life. <br>
I appreciate the little things and that keeps me going and makes me genuinely happy.
